# A pragmatic quick guide to TDD

A complete example of test-driving an endpoint using

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* JDBI
* Flyway

## The problem

The goal is to show a pragmatic use of Test-Driven Development from a seemingly real life experience.

This presents a few problem. We don't know the same domain. I have only some 30 minutes to show a way of working that
works extremely well for me.

I prefer, when possible, to do outside in development. This ensures that whatever I build is aimed for usage and not
hidden somewhere in the middle of a big ball of mud.

A step by step guide is available in [step-by-step-guide.md](step-by-step-guide.md).

The result of the presentation is available in different branches created after each presentation.
